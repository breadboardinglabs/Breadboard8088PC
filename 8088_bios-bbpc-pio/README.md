  * Add date and time setup to RTC setup utility
  * NVRAM setup utility - print help only if requested
  * Minor bug fixes and readability improvements in floppy code
  * Fix compilation errors with AT_COMPAT and PS2_MOUSE disabled

    * More clean and effective fdc_get_result implementation, fdc_wait_input removed as it no longer needed

* Version 0.7b
  * Initial public release


## TODO

* **(high)** Add technical documentation
* **(med)** Finalize extended keyboard support - full extended keyboard support
* **(med)** Beep if no video, install dummy handler
* **(low)** Xi 8088: Debug mouse issue with Intel 8242
* **(low)** Xi 8088: Debug issues with Microsoft and Logitech mouse drivers
* **(low)** Keyboard - sound on buffer overflow
* **(low)** More tests - RTC, memory, DMA
* **(low)** Init display before keyboard, so KBD errors can be displayed. Alternatively store non-fatal errors and display them after display is initialized
* **(low)** Check possibility of using same EBDA for XT-IDE BIOS and system BIOS PS/2 mouse functions
* **(low)** BIOS checksum
* **(enh)** Add PnP extension


## Switches and jumpers settings - Xi 8088

* SW2-8: Display adapter type:
  * Off = CGA
  * On = MDA or Hercules
  * Ignored if Video BIOS is present (EGA / VGA cards)

## BBPC changes
Breadboard PC changes and corrections and Programmed IO Changes to remove DMA from Floppy Disk accesses

Changes in setloc to allow BIOS to fit.

bios.asm Extra POST writes for FDC debug, additional lines for Nanocomp monitor, BBPC VGA Palette init, model_sub_byte added for MS PS/2 driver, extend ROM scan to look for XT-IDE BIOS at F8000

Config.inc has Breadboard PC Configuration added, default floppies A 1.44MB only

floppy1.inc Changes to remove DMA and add PIO, POST debug messages, Note Disk Change overridden due to DIP WD37C65C, DMA code commented out
fdc_wait_irq replaced with chk_stat_results or c, hk_stat_2 from PCJr BIOS, extra comments added, set_fdc_dor disables DMA and IRQ
chk_stat_results, chk_stat_2, bound_setup and rw_opn from PCJr BIOS

floppy2.inc has extra POST debug, EE leads disk read parameters, specify byte updated to disable DMA, Read and Write commands turned off multi-track, uses 1440 values by default not 2880

ps2aux.inc changes to get MS Mouse driver working, disable output of scaling, extra POST debug info,

video.inc Correction for working with MDA not waiting for CGA retrace (would hang), changes in CGA parameters for VGA 25Mhz output, call InitPalette for VGA DAC, disable light pen
